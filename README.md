# MachineLearning_Practices
My tiny machine learning projects and practices :)


[machine-learning-ex1](https://github.com/parsalotfy/MachineLearning_Practices/tree/main/machine-learning-ex1tp:// "machine-learning-ex1") , [machine-learning-ex2](https://github.com/parsalotfy/MachineLearning_Practices/tree/main/machine-learning-ex2 "machine-learning-ex2") and [machine-learning-ex3](https://github.com/parsalotfy/MachineLearning_Practices/tree/main/machine-learning-ex3 "machine-learning-ex3") are folders which I created during learning in [Andrew Ng ML Course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning "Andrew Ng ML Course").

In [Kaggle Folder](https://github.com/parsalotfy/MachineLearning_Practices/tree/main/Kaggle_Practices "Kaggle Folder") I put my tiniy simple projects to practice what I have learnt.
